# Homelab Archive

> [!NOTE]
> This is currently WIP, so the structure might change.

> [!WARNING]
> The configurations and setup's in this repo is no longer running on my homelab and therefore is not up-to-date, so use it for inspirations but don't expect it to be a working example.

Here I store old setup's and configurations that I have been running on my homelab, they have either been replaced by other services and tools, or just been removed due to inactivity.
